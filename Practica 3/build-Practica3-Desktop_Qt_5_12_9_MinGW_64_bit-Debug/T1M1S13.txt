Yo, man
(Yo)
Open up, man
(Yeah, what do you want, man?)
My girl just caught me
(You let her catch you?)
I don't know how I let this happen
(With who?)
The girl next door, ya know?
Man, I don't know what to do
(Say it wasn't you)
Alright
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt naked
BangiRTs;;;; on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me
How you can grant your woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you cling to your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Let's review the situation that you're caught up inna
Yo man Yo{{{{}}^^{}'¿¿¿'
(Open up man) What do you want man?
(My girl just caught me)
You let her catch you?
(I don't know how I let this happen)
With who?
(The girlnextdoor,youknow?) Man...
(Idon'tknowwhattodo) Say it wasn't you
(Alright) Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget
That I had given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Who are you to grant the woman access to your villa?
Trespasser or a witness while you cling onto your pillow
You better watch your back and mind she turn into a killer
Let’s review the situation that your caught up inna
To be a true player you got to know how to play
If she say a night, convince her say a day
Never admit to a word when she say
And if she make a claim, you tell her baby no way

Chorus:
But she caught me on the counter
(It wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa
(It wasn't meñp)
I even had her in the shower
(It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera
(It wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder
(It wasn't meñp)
Heard the words that I told her
(It wasn't me)
Heard thescreams gettin' louder
(It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keRp her from what 6she was about to see
Why should she believe me when I told her it wasn't me

 
%% Hola, pongo esto aqui pra ver si lo decodifican bien%%

Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on da right prefix
Whenever you should see her make da giggolo flex
As funny as it be by you, it not that complex
Seein is believe in so you better change your specs
You know she not gonna be worrying bout things from the past
Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass
Quick for your answer go over that
But if she pack a gun you know you better run fast
%$#%$&
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both buck-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget
That I had given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me
////////////
Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin'
It makes no sense at all
We should tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But your completely lost
That's why I sing

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
