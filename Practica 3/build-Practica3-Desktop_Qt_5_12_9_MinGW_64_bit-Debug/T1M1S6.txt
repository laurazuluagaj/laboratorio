Fightin for what they did not create cryin peace while inflicting pain (Forgive them)
Man deciding another man's fate claiming power in their God's name (Forgive them)

[Bridge: Shaggy (Background Singers)]

(They don't know) If they stick to the spot there be nothing else left to defend
(They don't know) Instead of finding a cure we should look for the means to prevent
(They don't know) We can talk to the lord ain't no need for a special event
Repent, repent, repent, repent

[Chorus:]

Cause where two steps away from a real disaster
Think there a boss but a who are the master
Life set a pace every thing much faster
Need to slow down and pray (Forgive them)
Two steps away from a real disaster
Think there a boss but a who are the master
Life set a pace every thing much faster
Need to slow down and pray (Forgive them)
